# ðŸ“Š Marketing Campaign Data Analysis

This project analyzes a **realistic 50k+ record marketing dataset** containing impressions, clicks, and conversions across multiple campaigns.  
The goal was to practice **end-to-end data analysis**: cleaning messy data, detecting anomalies, creating business KPIs, and generating insights that could guide marketing decisions.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing or zero click values.  
   - Removed duplicates and checked for schema consistency.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Gender breakdown of customers.  
   - Campaign-level performance (impressions vs conversions).  
   - Identified campaigns with high impressions but no clicks/conversions.  

3. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Flagged unusual conversion patterns (e.g., 0/1 conversion coding).  
   - Investigated outliers in impressions and clicks.  

4. **KPI Calculation**
   - Built metrics: CTR (Click-Through Rate), CVR (Conversion Rate), CPC (Cost per Click).  
   - Segmented results by gender, campaign type, and device.  

5. **Insights**
   - Highlighted campaigns wasting budget (high impressions, zero conversions).  
   - Found audience segments with the best ROI.  
   - Suggested optimization strategies for targeting and bidding.
